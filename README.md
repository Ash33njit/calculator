Stats Calculator Project
Authors: Adib Haque & Marlon Sarkor
Responsibilities: Shared Code and ReadME description

This program is a statistics calculator able to utilize and resolve multiple statistical functions such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation and
Z-Score. The program is based on the previous Calculator program which performed basic math functions. Inheritance was used to gain abilities from the original 
project. Encapsulation and abstraction were also demonstrated by using static methods to perform certain operations. The statistics calculator also checked values 
ensuring the correct data type. 

Below are descriptions for the different functions of a Stats Calculator. 

Mean: The mean is the sum of all given numbers divided by the number of numbers. The mean produces the average. Please see demonstation below:

Median: The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. 
The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.

Mode: The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. 
If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, X = x) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. 
In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.

Variance: Variance (Ïƒ2) in statistics is a measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. 
That is, it measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and therefore from every other number in the set.

Standard Deviation: In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 
A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Z-Score: In statistics, the standard score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of a raw score is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured. 
Raw scores above the mean have positive standard scores, while those below the mean have negative standard scores.
